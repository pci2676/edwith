      Needless to say, I keep her in check
      She was all bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
      Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
      Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)
      Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
      She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
      Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
      Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
      Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
      Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
      Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
      Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
